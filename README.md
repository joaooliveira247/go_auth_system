# 🔒 Go Auth System

The porpouse of this project is to implement an authentication system using [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/).

In addition to basic authentication features, the project aims to integrate other key components commonly used in scalable web applications, including:

-  ✅ Caching (Redis)

-  📩 Message Queueing (RabbitMQ)

- 🛡️ JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure, stateless authentication

- 📚 Middleware for handling authentication, rate limiting, and logging

This project is intended to serve as a reference or starting point for building robust authentication services in Go.
